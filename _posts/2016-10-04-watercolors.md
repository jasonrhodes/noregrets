Several people ask me for advice on how to get started with watercolors. I always recommend the [Kuretake kit.](http://amzn.to/2duYRNx) There is a good range of 14 colors in a compact box with space to mix more colors. Additionally, they include a 0.3 waterproof pen and a waterbrush. The waterbrush can be refilled with water and carried on the go inside the box, so you don't have to worry about having to carry a separate container to use your paints.
